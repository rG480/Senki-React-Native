## keys.json

keys.json is a file that should be in the route directory of your application. It allows for the application to connect to scandit and edamam for both the scanner and edamam food api respectively. Here's how it should be set up:

```
{
    "edamam_app_id": "app_id here",
    "edamam_app_key": "app_key here"
}
```
